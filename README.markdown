Spin Doctor - Arduino Tachometer/Speedometer with interactive LCD.
==================================================================

This circuit and firmware is used with a rotating magnet and fixed
hall-effect sensor to sense revolutions per minute, and display RPM
and surface speed (in several units) on an LCD.  Alternatively an
optical sensor may be used.

This project is intended for retrofitting digital display to rotary
tools such as lathes and saws.  It can also can be used for vehicle
speedometer/odometer or bike computer.

I was motivated to construct this project to confirm my estimation of the
undocumented output speeds of my second hand bandsaw and lathe.
